# RTOS TASKs -- Free RTOS

Author:Arthur Hua

Date:2/7/24

Inside is my RTOS_Light folder, which contains my code for binary blink, which was modified into a task, and a button press which I got from the button example, and a sinple light up for the blue light. The code makes the 4 leds blink in binary, and the blue led shines when we are counting down. The button reverses the direction of the counting.
