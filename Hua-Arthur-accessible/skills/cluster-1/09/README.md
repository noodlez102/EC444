# Servo 
Author: Arthur Hua
Date: 2/5/2024

I used the servo template that was provided by esp, and I also used the input code from my Console I/O to read inputs and checks if it is equal to s, where it would then set the angle to 0. The servo will keep running as normal, but it will first go to angle 0 if s is pressed.
