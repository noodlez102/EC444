# Building a Stopwatch
Author: Arthur Hua
Date: 2/8/24

Inside my code folder is my Stopwatch code. I took code from my button press for the binary code in order to read the button interuppt, and code for my alphanumeric display, and I used the timer code as base to increment my global variable timer at which the tasks I made can change and interact with them.
