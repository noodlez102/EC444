# Use GPIO to Drive LEDs

I used the esp Blink example template to creat Binary Blink, which is inside the code folder. Inside Binary Blink is a main folder which contains blink_example_main.c which is where I did all my coding.

I changed the example code by changing the configure led function to take in an int and configure it, and the main code where I have it count up to 15 based on a bool, or down from 15 and changed the state of the leds based on what number it is.
