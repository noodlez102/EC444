# Alphanumeric Display
Author: Arthur Hua
Date:2/6/24

Inside my code folder is the folder I used to work on the alpha numeric display. I used sample code template as my base which didn't have anything in it, then I copied  the given example code. Then I got the alpha bitwise cheat to help display what I need, and used RTOS to have it both read and loop the display. I got my read code from my Console I/O skill. Now It can Autoscroll when also reading in from the uart. So type anything into the serial console, and hit enter, then it will print it out of the display and loop it.
