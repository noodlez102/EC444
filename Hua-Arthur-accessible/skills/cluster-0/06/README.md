# Console I/O

In the code folder is a folder called echo which contains the workspace where I coded for this skill. Inside main is uart_echo_example_main.c
where I first got the example code from, then modified it to complete the assignment.

I kept the most of the previous initializations for this code, and added from from the blink assignment so we can toggle blink.
I used a dynamic array to store the value of the key input everytime, and when the user hits enter it will do something based on the toggle.
I adopted the blink code from somewhere else but everything else was written by me.
