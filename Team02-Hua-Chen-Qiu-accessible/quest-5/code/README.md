# Code Readme

We developed an AI-driven car that relied on images from a Raspberry Pi camera and LiDAR to detect potential collisions. To gather data, we initially controlled the car using a Node.js website, assigning labels to define desired states for the car. Subsequently, we conducted testing in a custom-built environment, maneuvering the car through it multiple times to capture data for various actions such as driving straight, turning left or right, detecting obstacles in front, and correcting its course. Using TensorFlow, we trained our model and integrated it back into our website, enabling the car to be controlled autonomously by the trained model.Please describe in this readme what is in your code folder and
