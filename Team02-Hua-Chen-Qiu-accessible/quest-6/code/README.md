# Code Readme

We created a rock paper scissors robot that uses machine learning and modeling to recognize the hand signal and then output the correct hand symbol to beat the player. The design included a picam that sends the image to the laptop that has a trained model from a dataset that we made to recognize the hand signal, which goes to the node server and graphs the number of each signal. We used a lidar sensor to recognize when a hand is in the box to start the game.
